# CXJ_MZ RPG Maker MZ Plugins
A repository for RPG Maker MZ plugins by GaryCXJk

## About these plugins
These plugins are added tho this repository to keep the plugins
up-to-date faster. These plugins will be available before they
appear on the main site, [area91.garycxjk.com](https://area91.garycxjk.com), though
most of the time they are either untested or not properly documented.

## Why this repository?
Sometimes I'm working on a plugin, and never actually end up
finishing it. Or sometimes I don't feel like making a page for
it for a long time because converting the instructions to HTML
takes too long and I'm too lazy to write a converter myself.

Also, while the plugins are MIT licensed, I still want to keep
it in record that I actually made this, so that nobody can actually
claim to own these plugins other than me, since git actually helps
in keeping a timestamp. This is more for your protection rather than
mine, as I also don't want people to be scammed by plugin resellers.

### Why not make them paid?

The reason is very simple. Taxes. I hate doing them, and anything
that can give me income will make it so that I have to file it on
my tax report. It's too much of a hassle.

Plus, making plugins paid comes with the price that you have a
responsibility to keep them maintained. People expect quality from
a paid product. Because my plugins are free, I can waive this
responsibility, since you're free to make your own adjustments.

Finally, I'm on the side of those who want to make software open
source. People learn from the codes of others, which is also why I'm
putting the effort of adding comments. They're mostly for my own sake,
but also so that others can work off them, instead of just copying and
pasting them in their own work.

Look, coding isn't simple, it's something you need to learn. The best
way to learn it is by doing it yourself, by learning from the ground up.
Always start at the basics, which means follow tutorials or courses from
the beginning. There are no shortcuts. If you don't know the difference
between an integer and a string, you have no business doing the more
complicated stuff.

But once you're there, once you know all the important data types, loop
blocks, conditional statements, operators, objects, prototypes, and even
ES6 stuff like classes, promises and asynchronous functions, being able
to read somebody else's code can help. Truth is, no programmer is
perfect, and no code is the best. Heck, I do programming for a living
and I still don't do things perfectly.

In the end, my code is just a stepping stone. Most of the stuff I make
is stuff that's only useful for programmers, plugin developers. Not a lot
that I make is really ready to use for the regular RPG Maker users.
If a beginning JavaScript programmer learns even a tiny bit from my
code, then that's a mission accomplished.
